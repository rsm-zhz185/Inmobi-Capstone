# UCSD Rady Capstone Project - Inmobi

## Overview
This capstone project is part of the UCSD Rady School of Management curriculum, in collaboration with InMobi. Our goal is to analyze user location data from the 1Weather app and enrich it with public datasets (e.g., census data, POI data) to infer user personas and behavioral patterns.

## Objectives
- Perform descriptive analysis on user movement and location trends.
- Build predictive models to estimate user attributes (e.g., home/work location) with confidence scores.
- Ensure privacy by excluding sensitive or private locations in all analyses.
